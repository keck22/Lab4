# Executive Summary

The purpose of this lab was to learn the differences between raster and vector graphics, along with the differences in lossless and lossy compressions. This lab also had a purpose of showing similarities and differences between a variety of file formats. The lab also allows you to learn more about your own computers operating systems. Learning how to make a logo and learn about file sizes is also taught in this lab. 

# Graphics

## Raster vs. Vector Graphics

* Raster - It is what happens when you zoom in on a small image made up of thousands of pixels and it loses image quality making the pixels invisible. An example would be when you are viewing a logo on a website. 
* Vector - Vector graphics can be made to be any size without losing the image quality. An example of when to use this type of image would be in professional design settings. 

## Lossless vs. Lossy Compression

Lossless image formats preserve the original file size when it was made. Lossy image formats compress the file size, in my understanding this would help with load and processing times. 

## File Formats

* jpg (Joint Photographic Experts Group) - JPG is an image format that uses lossy compression in order to create smaller file sizes. One of its biggest advantages is that it allows designers to decide how much compression is used on the file, which can result in better image quality.  
* gif (Graphics Interchange Format) - GIF is a bitmap image format that supports up to 8 bits per pixel. One of its biggest advantages is that it allows for animated images, something neither of the other formats provide.  
* png (Portable Network Graphics) - PNG is also a bitmap image format just like GIF, but PNG uses lossless data compression. This makes JPG and PNG different in compression terms. One of PNG's biggest advantages is that it can support a number of transparancy options.

## Logo

A copy of my logo is posted in this folder.

My logo consisted of 38 layers to make a digital pepperoni pizza with my pizza shop's name over it. I used ellipses and the text feature to make my logo. I also used the pen feature to make the slices for my pizza. 
My logo had to be saved as a PDF document on my Macbook, it did not accept it as an svg image file. The file size is 10,626 bytes and opens with Preview which is an applicaiton already installed on my Macbook. 

# Conclusion

After this lab I have learned the differences between lossless and lossy compressions in image formats. I also was able to find out some similarities and differences between commonly used file formats; JPG, PNG, and GIF. Lastly, I learned how to create a logo from scratch.
